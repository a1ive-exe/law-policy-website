However, these requirements can create significant barriers to international trade and digital commerce.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nOur research reveals three critical areas of concern:\n1. Economic impact on digital services\n2. Privacy and security trade-offs\n3. Regulatory fragmentation\n\n## Recommendations\n\nWe propose a framework for balancing data sovereignty with economic efficiency.",

Prolonged litigation timelines\n2. Limited access for informal workers\n3. Inadequate mediation infrastructure\n4. Fragmented regulatory framework\n\n## Proposed Reforms\n\n### 1. Digital Dispute Resolution Platform\nEstablish a centralized digital platform for filing and tracking disputes, reducing paperwork and improving transparency.\n\n### 2. Mandatory Pre-litigation Mediation\nRequire parties to attempt mediation before proceeding to formal adjudication, reducing court backlog.\n\n### 3. Specialized Fast-Track Courts\nCreate specialized labour courts with dedicated timelines for resolution.\n\n### 4. Enhanced Worker Protections\nExpand protections for gig economy and contract workers.\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n\nPhase 1 (Months 1-6): Digital platform development\nPhase 2 (Months 7-12): Pilot mediation programs\nPhase 3 (Months 13-18): Court restructuring\nPhase 4 (Months 19-24): Full rollout\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese reforms will create a more efficient, accessible, and equitable labour dispute resolution system.",
